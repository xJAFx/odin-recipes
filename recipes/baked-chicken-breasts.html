        <h2>Simple Baked Chicken Breasts</h2>
        <p>Follow along this recipe to bake your own delicious Chicken Breasts!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken Breasts</strong>: The most important ingredient, it's best to use boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: It provides moisture and prevents the chicken breasts from drying out, while helping them to cook more evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Your favorite sea salt will do.</li>
            <li><strong>Creole Seasoning</strong>: It adds flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong>: Use chicken broth to make a pan sauce to pour over the baked breasts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Season Chicken</h4>
            <p>Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with salt and creole seasoning.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Bake Chicken</h4>
            <p>Place the seasoned chicken in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about 10 minutes, then flip and continue to bake for about 15 more minutes
                (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is done baking, transfer it to a plate.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Finish With Pan Sauce</h4>
            <p>Pour the chicken broth into the pan you used to bake the chicken. Scrape any browned bits off the side with a spatula. Drizzle the pan sauce over the baked chicken before serving.</p></li>
